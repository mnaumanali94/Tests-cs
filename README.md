TesterPCL
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC v2.0

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a few NuGet Packages e.g., Newtonsoft.Json, UniRest.
The reference to these packages is already added as in the packages.config file.
If the automatic NuGet package restore is enabled, these dependencies will be 
installed automatically. Therefore, you will need internet access for build.

    1. Unarchive the downloaded zip file.
    2. Open the solution (*.sln) file.
    3. Invoke the build process using "F6" key or "CTL+LSHIFT+B" shortcut.

How To Test: 
=============
The generated SDK also contain one or more Tests, which are contained in the Tests project.
In order to invoke these test cases, you will need *NUnit 3.0 Test Adapter Extension for Visual Studio*.
Once the SDK is complied, the test cases should appear in the Test Explorer window.
Here, you can click *Run All* to execute these test cases.

How To Use:
===========
The build process generates a portable class library, which can be used like
a normal class library. The generated library is compatible with Windows Forms,
Windows RT, Windows Phone 8, Silverlight 5, Xamarin iOS, Xamarin Android and
Mono. More information on how to use can be found at the following link.
